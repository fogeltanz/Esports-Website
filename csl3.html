        	<h1>CSL Info Coming Soon</h1>
            <p>Time to step up your game! As CSL Team lead, I would like to announce that we are actively looking to add two-four additional members to the 1v1 roster. Currently the roster consists of Michael Wolf, Jacob Stoffregen, and myself. If CSL decides to keep its 2v2 format, we will be adding on Connor Hansen and be looking for a partner for him. 

Requirements that must be met in order to be considered for a position:

1) Player must currently reside in Master League or Grand Master League - Yes this is asking a lot, however, I would not submit a lineup when we are not in top shape and unfortunately, diamond league and below is not top shape.

2) Player must maintain active throughout the year - School always comes first, this is known. Outside of that, being a part of CSL means that you are making a commitment to THE TEAM. By not laddering, playing customs, talking strategy, you are not pulling your own weight and are letting the team down. I would expect each member of the team to have minimum of 100 ladder games a season. 

3) Player agrees to be on time for every match - Matches are once a week either in the later part of the week or on a weekend depending on your region/division. By becoming a member of the CSL team, you are agreeing to do everything possible to be online and able to play at this time every week.

4) Player is willing to travel to LAN events – Throughout the year we make trips to LAN events. In the past they have been in Ohio, Minnesota, and Illinois. These trips will take up entire weekends and will be mandatory for all members to attend. 

5) Player needs to play to win – All members of the CSL team are driven by competition. The ultimate goal is to win every match. Unfortunately, everyone loses. These losses should not be taken lightly as they will not be by your teammates. Passion is what drives, fuels, and encourages us to win. Thus, it must be shown.

6) Player agrees to lose with dignity – We represent the University of Wisconsin Madison not only when we travel, but when we play online under the school’s name. A “GLHF” is mandatory at the beginning of each game as well as a “GG” at the end. Any other talking during the game is forbidden by CSL league rules. Any raging/ bad mannering at the end of a game will result in an automatic suspension from the team. We act professional, we look profession, and we are professionals. 

Don’t let the master league requirement scare you away. The club has multiple players right now sitting in platinum and diamond league, all with the potential to be masters in a matter of weeks. Not only do we have race coaches, we have a multitude of gamers that are available to practice and talk strategy with. Esport club members, it’s time to step up your game. Get out there, get that master league promotion, and reap the reward of being part of a team that shares the same passion for the game of StarCraft that you do. 

The Team needs YOU!
